# features/audit

**Owner: Pranay**

Automated profile audit: what is missing or wrong across the owner's online presence, scored and turned into fixable findings.

## Where this appears
The Health section of the Business tab, plus its own detail routes.

## Boundary rules

1. Everything for this feature lives in this folder: screens, hooks, provider
   implementations, feature-specific types, and its own tests.
2. **Do not edit another feature's folder.** If you need something from one,
   ask its owner to export it from that feature's `index.ts`.
3. **Do not edit `components/ui/`, `components/shared/`, `theme/` or
   `lib/` to make this feature work.** Those are shared. If a primitive is
   missing a variant, raise it with the team and add it there with a test -
   never fork a copy in here and never restyle one with inline colours.
4. Register any provider implementation at runtime with
   `registerProvider(id, impl)` from `@/lib/providers`. Do not add your
   provider to `lib/providers/registry.ts` by hand.
5. Add routes under `app/` only for screens this feature owns.

## Data rules (non-negotiable)

- Return `DataState<T>` from anything that touches the network.
- **Unknown is not zero.** No placeholder `0`, no empty chart standing in for
  missing data, no invented percentages. Use `unavailable(reason, message)`.
- Never claim an integration exists before it does.
- Never present fixture data as the owner's real data. Fixtures live in
  `fixtures/`, are only readable when `isFixtureModeEnabled()` is true, and
  any screen showing them must pass `showsFixtureData` to `<Screen>`.

## Before you implement an integration

Run the API research agent (`.claude/agents/api-researcher.md`) and commit its
findings to `docs/research/`. Do not guess scopes, quotas, pricing or review
requirements.

## Watch out

- `Score` takes `number | null`. Pass `null` until an audit has genuinely
  run - a business that has never been audited does not have a score of 0.
- Report `uncheckedAreas` honestly. A score derived from half the signals must
  say so; `<Score uncheckedCount={n} />` renders that caveat.
